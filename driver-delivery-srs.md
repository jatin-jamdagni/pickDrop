## 6. Database Design

### 6.1 Schema Description

#### Driver Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE driver (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    vehicle_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255),
    name VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Route Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE route (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    driver_id INTEGER REFERENCES driver(id),
    start_time TIMESTAMP,
    end_time TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### PickupPoint Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE pickup_point (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    route_id INTEGER REFERENCES route(id),
    latitude DECIMAL(10,8),
    longitude DECIMAL(11,8),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Destination Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE destination (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    route_id INTEGER REFERENCES route(id),
    latitude DECIMAL(10,8),
    longitude DECIMAL(11,8),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    reached_at TIMESTAMP,
    delivered_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
